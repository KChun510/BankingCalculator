Using the python interface "tkinter", I created a calculator that computes basic banking calculations. 
This project was meant to experiment with creating a working UI, that receives multiple forms of input. 

My app can currently calculate, apr, simple interest, compound interest, and monthly payments. New functions/additions are simple formulas, transferred to code.
